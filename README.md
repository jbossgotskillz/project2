Name:  Jordan Woodard

Overview:  This is a school project for an image search app that I made called "CrazyNinja".  The concept for the CrazyNinja app centers around building a "ninja school" that "teaches" its "students" how to find images for their projects.  Therefore, I used a theme based on ninjas and the art of ninjutsu (or ninja arts).

Details:  CrazyNinja contains an API search engine called Giphy.  There are four sections on the app:  Home, Tutorial, Image Gallery, and Registration.  A navigation bar features links for each section, while the ends of each section feature buttons that take users back to the navigation bar.  The image search is done under the Tutorial section.  Meanwhile, there are two other forms:  one under the Tutorial section and one under the Registration section.  Both of them can be interacted with.

Technologies:  html, css, js
